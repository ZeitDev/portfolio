                        <p>
                            <strong>Definition of Commercial Use:</strong> For the purposes of this agreement, commercial use is deemed to exist if the Aerial Camera Simulator is used in order to train persons who carry out paid activities for the purchaser. It is also considered commercial use if the Aerial Camera Simulator is used as a part of paid lessons for other people. In all cases not listed here, commercial use is excluded.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Commercial Use License:</strong> If you wish to use the Aerial Camera Simulator for any commercial purpose, you must obtain a separate commercial license from Léon Zeitler. Please contact <a href="mailto:contact@leonzeitler.com" className="text-blue-400 hover:underline">contact@leonzeitler.com</a> or <a href="https://leonzeitler.com/#contact" className="text-blue-400 hover:underline">https://leonzeitler.com/#contact</a> for more information.

However, Léon Zeitler shall only be entitled to terminate the contract immediately if the purchaser fails to remedy the breach of contract within a reasonable period of time following a written request by Léon Zeitler. The elimination of the condition contrary to the contract shall also include the acquisition of the licenses that would have had to be acquired for the use contrary to the contract in the event of dutiful conduct. This only requires the acquisition for the period of use in breach of contract. The dispensability of setting a deadline is governed by Section 314 (2) of the German Civil Code (BGB).

                        <p>
                            Aerial Camera Simulator ("Licensed Application") is a piece of software created to simulate what the operation of a 3D moving cable-suspended camera system might look like on a computer — and customized for Mac and Windows devices ("Devices"). It is used to operate a virtual 3D moving cable-suspended camera system.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Licensed Application is not tailored to comply with industry-specific regulations (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), etc.), so if your interactions would be subjected to such laws, you may not use this Licensed Application. You may not use the Licensed Application in a way that would violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).
